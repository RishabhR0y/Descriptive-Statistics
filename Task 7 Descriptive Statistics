"""MEAN"""'

"""Mean or Average is a central tendency of the data i.e. a number around which a whole data is spread out. 
In a way, it is a single number that can estimate the value of the whole data set."""


data.head()

data.mean(axis = 0)

"""""Median""""

"""Median is the value that divides the data into 2 equal parts
i.e. number of terms on the right side of it is the same as a number of terms on the left side of it when data is arranged 
in either ascending or descending order."""


data.median(axis = 0)

"""Mode"""

"""Mode is the term appearing maximum time in data set i.e. term that has the highest frequency."""


data.mode(axis = 0)

"""""Variance"""""

"""variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average), 
and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: σ2."""


data.var(axis = 0)

"""Standard Deviation"""

"""Standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean 
and is calculated as the square root of the variance.
The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance σ2
by determining each data point's deviation relative to the mean."""


data.std(axis = 0)

"""Correlation""""

"""The correlation coefficient is a simple descriptive statistic that measures the strength of the linear relationship
between two interval- or ratio-scale variables 
(as opposed to categorical, or nominal-scale variables), as might be visualized in a scatter plot. """


data.corr(method ='kendall')

"""Normal Distribution"""

"""The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean,
so the right side of the center is a mirror image of the left side. 
The area under the normal distribution curve represents probability and the total area under the curve sums to one."""
